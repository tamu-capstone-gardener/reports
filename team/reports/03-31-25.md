# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Plantir

**Week**: Week 11 

**Members**: Caden Miller, Alex Garrido, Kevin Johnson, Mihir Gonsalves

## Status Report

We have made a lot of progress with the system integration and the website. We have made a standard setup procedure for the hardware and ESP code. We have polished the website, specifically the data collection and plant database. For the data collection the process is now multi-threaded and will collect and log data in the background. For the plant database, we have upgraded and expanded our database from roughly 900 plants to 5000 plants. Furthermore, we have built the hydroponic system or at least an outline for it. We have made progress on the notification side of things now having thresholds detected remotely, but we still need to work on better and more prevalent control over relays that work on the care schedule decided by the user.
