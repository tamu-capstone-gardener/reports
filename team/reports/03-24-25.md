# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Plantir

**Week**: 10

**Members**: Caden Miller, Alex Garrido, Kevin Johnson, Mihir Gonsalves

## Status Report

Circuit is basically complete. Pot is fully built. Connection between hardware and software is set up and working. All systems work individually, most are connected to each other but need some final integration polish. Overall our team is in a good place. A lot of progress was made this past sprint and all that is needed at the core level is some polish. We will begin working on the hydroponic garden this week so that we can demo two separate modules working with the web app simulataneously. Our main challenge is racing the clock, but with effort (which we have much to spare), everything should eventually simply come together. We will also begin working on the social media aspect of the web app (like reddit with a focus on users tracking progress and giving a guide on how to grow specific plants).
