# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Plantir

**Week**: Week 12

**Members**: Caden Miller, Alex Garrido, Kevin Johnson, Mihir Gonsalves

## Status Report

The team worked on making the control signals (relays) work as well as finalizing the email notifications and completed the in-soil garden. Now all relays are controllable manually, off of a schedule, and automatically based on the sensor readings. Email notifications are configurable by the user and sent from our shared planthub gmail; furthermore, they can be set to notify the user based on a threshold (i.e. if soil moisture <= 1000, email user). The in-soil garden now has a self-contained reservoir that rests under the pot for better drainage. Lastly, the wires are now much more hidden and one can very easily refill the water from the sides.
