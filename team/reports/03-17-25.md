# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Plantir

**Week**: 9 (03/17/25)

**Members**: Alex Garrido-Millan, Caden Miller, Kevin Johnson, Mihir Gonsalves


## Status Report

*Write a one-third to one-half page status report describing the team’s overall progress and challenges faced last week. Also discuss the team’s goals and plan for this week.*

Last week, the team made good progress on multiple aspects of the Plantir project. We are nearing finalization on the hardware side of the project. Our grow light and relays have finally come in through mail. We are finalizing our circuit - connecting the grow light to the wall and the rest of the components to a battery. We are planning on implementing a camera on board for users to monitor progress more visually/remotely. On the software side, the Web UI's light mode and dark mode has been completed. We have also established a connection between the ESP32 and our rails server.

Our team has encountered problems with the MQTT connection between the ESP32 and the rails server. For now the data seems to be the incorrect format, but that should not take too long to adjust. We also have encountered some problems with our circuit. Implementing a battery is important to us, so we are currently planning on using a battery to power everything besides the grow light and having the grow light connected to a wall socket via a relay.

## Plans for Next Week

| Task | Task Lead | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ----- |
| Get camera working | Mihir | Build a circuit for the camera to capture photos of the plant and get recommendations working for schedules and plants |
| Finishing water pump and implementing camera system |Alex| figure out how to make a homemade smart plug with a power adapterq |
| Fix data formatting for MQTT and establish connection from camera to rails server|Kevin| process data from sensors and camera |
| Update the website by adding reccomendations for the plants, start working on the social media aspect |Caden| Social Media will be more like reddit, where people can publish their charts and describe their plant's development |
