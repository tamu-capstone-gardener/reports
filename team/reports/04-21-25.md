# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Plantir

**Week**: Week 15

**Members**: Caden Miller, Alex Garrido, Kevin Johnson, Mihir Gonsalves

## Status Report

The team has made progress with the camera feature which has been integrated with the deployed site. The challenges we have faced is that the system is no longer connecting consistently, which has led to issues with the demo. We have tested with the ESP32 connected to a laptop and the wall, but we now seek to try to overcome this bug. We will try to accomplish this by switching the ESP32 in the in-soil module for our other ESP32 and ensuring the connections are necessary and secure. Furthermore, because the battery must be disconnected for EPS, we shall remove the software setup and hardware connections to this part of the circuit.
