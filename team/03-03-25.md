## Status Report

*Write a one-third to one-half page status report describing the team’s overall progress and challenges faced last week. Also discuss the team’s goals and plan for this week.*
Last week, the team made significant progress on multiple aspects of the Plantir project. The main hardware component, the self-watering pot, is nearing completion. A major milestone was reached with the partial assembly of the pot, requiring additional work for finalization. On the software side, the Web UI received updates, improving usability and functionality. The team encountered some challenges related to the water pump, specifically the need for a relay. Additionally, further research is required for selecting a grow light, camera, and appropriate power adapters. 

Despite these challenges, the team is functioning effectively, maintaining a steady workflow and distributing tasks efficiently. Notable advancements include hardware assembly, improved understanding of MQTT integration with Rails, UI development using CSS and Stimulus, and circuit building. Looking ahead, the focus will be on finalizing the self-watering pot, integrating new hardware components, and continuing software enhancements.
