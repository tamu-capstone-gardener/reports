### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

I ran into some issues when testing my watering feature - because our seeding data generates plant modules with random users
when my authentication limited the modules that the user can see to what the user already has, nothing appeared. Thus, I created
a quick test create function that created a dummy module owned by the user that I can use for testing.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

I think we are making good progress and are on pace to complete it on time.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

I think we are all working well together.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I developed better ruby on rails skills and intuition.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

My most awesome team member this week was Caden for his contributions in building the hardware.

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

I plan on helping with the hardware connection and then ensuring that the sensors can load data into the database.
Hopefully, we can start working on the water pump as well.
