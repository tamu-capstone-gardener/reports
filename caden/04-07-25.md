### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
The notifications were a little hard to setup and push notifications still need to be added. Furthermore, the scheduling matching with a proposed care schedule could use some improvement. I plan to continue working through these issues to get a solid final product. 


### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
The project is in a good state - we need to finish the hydroponic garden.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is functioning well - more work is needed but I think everyone will contribute from here.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I have done a ton of work with MQTT and general Rails work as well.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
My most awesome team member was Mihir because he came over this weekend and worked a lot on refining the in-soil plant module. 


## Plans for Next Week
My plans for next week are primarily to continue woring on the software and also help with the hardware of the hydroponic module.
