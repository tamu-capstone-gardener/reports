### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
The pot can no longer be powered using a battery. 
The grow light in combination with the water pump simply requires too much voltage, which forces us to plug in the system to the wall.
We have to now get a new relay that can be assembled with a wall socket in mind.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
We are ever so slightly behind, but I think by next week (demo) we can have a near compelte prototype. Then we will have to work/grind the software.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Team is still functioning well together. We definitely slowed down this past week, regardless I believe we can complete the project in time without too much extra stress.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I learned about relays and stripping/crimping wires.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Kevin was my most awesome team member this week because he seemingly went through hell and back to get the ESP32 module to establish a connection with our rails server.


## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*
We will finish completing the hardware portion of the pot. 
I will work on connecting the system to the wall through a relay and begin working on a camera subsystem (so that a person can track plant growth more visually/remotely).
