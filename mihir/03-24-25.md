# Individual Weekly Report

**Name**: Mihir Gonsalves

**Team**: Plantir

**Date**: 03/24/2025

## Current Status
Circuit is basically complete. Pot is fully built. Connection between hardware and software is set up and working. All systems work individually, most are connected to each other but need some final polish.

### What did _you_ work on this past week?

| Task | Status | Time Spent | 
| ---- | ------ | ---------- |
|   Hardware Software Connectivity (esp sends and recieves data to and from web app in real time)  |    Complete    |      3 hours      |
|   Implemeneted relays, implemented pump and connected it to relay adnd web app   |    Complete    |      3 hours      |
|   Camera setup   |    In progress    |      1.5 hours      |

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
We didn't really run into any problems. Integrating the camera will be a lot more difficult than anticipated (the format of data is strange), but with time it should hopefully just work.


### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
We made a lot of progress this previous sprint, by next week (03/31/25) we should have the first module fully complete (presentable to all parties evaluating our system). We need to start working on the hydroponic garden (which functions basically the same as the regular garden, so should not be difficult). 


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is working really well. Everyone is completing important tasks that help make significant progress towards our end goal. Everyone always participates and communicates in a professional, engaging, and fun manner. Our team is making enough progress that we 


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I learned about MQTT communication. I didn't necessarily develop any new skills, everything from the first 6 weeks now builds onto and into each other.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
I have two most awesome team members this week. 
Firstly, Alex managed to get the water pump working. Theoretically, our circuit was fine and in practice it is fine. One thing Alex found, though, was for the relay connected to the pump to actually work, we have to short the +/- terminals using a voltmeter. 
Secondly, Kevin managed to get the MQTT communication between the hardware and software setup. This allowed us to integrate our systems seamlessly and helped us make a lot of progress this sprint.

## Plans for Next Week
*What are you going to work on this week?*

Integrate hardware and physicalware (the actual pot)
Begin working on hydroponic garden
